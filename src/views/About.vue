              <p>
                This website is set up to for use without creating a profile. On
                the home page you can see all the events starting on the current
                date. Hit the "Show More" button on the bottom of the page to
                see more events. Click on the event title or picture to see more
                details about the event including a description, ticket info,
                and tags.
              </p>

              <p>
                The events on the home page can be filtered via the search bar
                (looks at event titles and description), date, and tags.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once a profile is created and logged in a user can submit an
                event by clicking on the link in the navigation bar and favorite
                events by clicking on the star item and turning it gold. To see
                all of your favorited events click on your "User Profile" in the
                top right corner of the page
              </p>

                    This web application is the capstone project of my time at
                    the Actualize coding bootcamp. When the coronavirus pandemic
                    hit NYC and the entire city shut down my packed calendar of
                    summer shows and tours unravelled as the cancellations
                    rolled in.

                    After a couple weeks I decided to use this free time,
                    something a freelance musician rarely has, to study a
                    previous interest, software development. Three months of
                    intensive coding and I have this first project complete.
